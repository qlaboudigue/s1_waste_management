# s1_waste_management

##Problem presentation / interpretation

Based on data about wastes generated by the population, the program aims at calculating the generated CO2 regarding the different machines available. Machines deal with specific types of waste.

##Set-up & source code

    The project has been developed in Dart (POO language), using Flutter framework.
    Runner available under ~/lib/main
    Source code available under ~/lib

##Method & estimated time

    Basic modelisation of the problem (Inputs, main function, wanted outputs) - (3 hours).
    Modelisation of the business logic based on the POO(SOLID) principles - (2 hours).
    Implementation of the model - (2 hours).
    Import and decode input data from JSON - (4 hours).
    Implementation of the WasteManager Class responsible for solving the core problem - (4 hours).
    Display results - (4 hours).

##Progress & time spent per task

    Session 1 : Read.me file creation et business logic modelisation on paper (1 hour).
    Session 2 : Graphic modelisation of the business logic (3 hours).
    Session 3 : Tutorial about managing (decoding using classes) every situation in a .json file. (3 hours).
    Session 4 : Full input decode (2 hours).
    Session 5 : Implementing business models (2 hours).
    Session 6 : Thinking about business models and ways of calculating results / Stuck (5 days).
    Session 7 : Finally understanding the waste manager purpose (2 hours).
    Session 8 : Killing the assignment with full refactoring of business models + waste manager class (with algorithm) + calculation implementation + results displaying.

## Results

Waste quantities by type based on data.json :

    {
    PET: 15662.689999999997,
    PVC: 18193.93,
    PC: 8764.06,
