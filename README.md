    The project has been developped in Dart (POO language), using Flutter framework.
    Runner available under ~/lib/main
    Source code available under ~/lib

##Method & estimated time

    Basic modelisation of the problem (Inputs, main function, wanted outputs) - (3 hours).
    Modelisation of the business logic based on the POO(SOLID) principles - (2 hours).
    Implementation of the model - (2 hours).
    Import and decode input data from JSON - (4 hours).
